    <h1>The Evolution of SEO: From Keywords to User Intent</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">By SEO Specialist | February 9, 2026</p>

    <article class="blog-post" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <p>Search Engine Optimization has undergone a radical transformation over the last two decades. Understanding
            this history helps us predict where the algorithm is going next.</p>

        <h2>Era 1: The Keyword Stuffing Age (Late 90s - Early 2000s)</h2>
        <p>In the beginning, search engines were simple matching machines. If you put "cheap flights" on your page 100
            times, you ranked for "cheap flights." This led to unreadable, spammy pages.</p>

        <h2>Era 2: The Backlink Gold Rush (Mid 2000s - 2012)</h2>
        <p>Google revolutionized search with PageRank. Links became votes. This created an economy of buying and selling
            links, leading to the Penguin algorithm update which penalized unnatural link profiles.</p>

        <h2>Era 3: The Mobile & Voice Revolution (2013 - 2019)</h2>
        <p>As smartphones took over, Google shifted to "Mobile-First Indexing." Speed and responsiveness became ranking
            factors. Voice search introduced natural language queries.</p>

        <h2>Era 4: The AI & Intent Era (2020 - Present)</h2>
        <p>With BERT and MUM, and now the advanced AI models of 2026, Google understands <em>nuance</em>. It doesn't
            just match keywords; it tries to solve the user's problem.</p>

        <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
        <p>Today, your content must satisfy "User Intent." If a user searches for "best running shoes," they want a list
            and reviews, not a history of shoelaces. If your page answers their question quickly and thoroughly, you
            win.</p>
